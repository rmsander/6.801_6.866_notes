# MIT 6.801/6.866: Machine Vision
This repository contains notes and LaTeX for MIT's 6.801/6.866 Machine Vision course from the Fall 2020 semester.  This course is taught by Professor Berthold K.P. Horn, and focuses on geometric computer vision.

To view the PDF lecture notes, simply select the lecture number from this GitHub repository.  To edit the LaTeX code used to generate these PDFs, you can do so by editing the files in `tex`.

## Overview of Course
This course covers the theretical foundations of machine vision, a branch of artificial intelligence designed for teaching robots to "see" and solve problems in object detection and recognition, edge detection, orientation estimation, photogrammetry, and other pertinent problems in robotics.  The course supplements theory with practical patent applications, such as David Lowe's Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).

## Editing TeX Files
If you're interested in adding your own notes to the existing TeX files, you can do so by editing the `.tex` files in the `tex/` folder.
